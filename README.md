## 📖 Detailed Usage

### Extracting Bundles
Extracts all embedded files from a single-file bundle.
- Files are extracted to `work/<bundle-name>/`
- Original structure is preserved
- Progress bar shows extraction status

### Repacking Bundles
Creates a new patched bundle with modified files.
- Only modified files need to be present
- Original bundle must remain in `in/` folder
- Automatic backup is created
- Output: `<name>_patched_<timestamp>.exe`

### Hash Verification
Verify bundle integrity using saved hashes.

1. **Export hashes** (Option 6 → Hash verification)
2. **Modify files** in work folder
3. **Verify** to see what changed
   - Shows modified files
   - Displays old vs new hashes
   - Identifies added/removed files

### Bundle Comparison
Compare two bundles side-by-side.
- File count differences
- Added/removed files
- Size differences
- Architecture comparison

### Search
Find specific files across all bundles in `in/` folder.
```
Search term: appsettings.json
Results:
  📦 App1.exe
    ✓ appsettings.json (2.34 KB)
  📦 App2.exe
    ✓ appsettings.production.json (1.89 KB)
```

## 📂 Directory Structure

```
DotNetBundlePatcher/
├── in/          ← Place original bundles here
├── work/        ← Extracted files (edit these)
├── out/         ← Patched bundles output
├── logs/        ← Session logs
├── backup/      ← Automatic backups
└── exports/     ← Exported manifests
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Batch Extract
Extract all bundles in `in/` folder at once:
1. Option `5` (Batch Operations)
2. Option `1` (Extract All)

### Export Manifest
Generate detailed bundle report:
1. Option `6` (Export Bundle Manifest)
2. Choose format: JSON, XML, or TXT
3. Find in `exports/` folder

### Verify Integrity
Check if bundle was modified:
1. Export hashes before modification
2. Make changes
3. Run verification to see differences

## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Code Signing**: Repacked bundles lose original signatures
- **Testing**: Always test in isolated environment first
- **Backups**: Tool creates automatic backups, but keep your own too
- **Legality**: Only modify software you own or have rights to

### Recommended Workflow
1. ✅ Create manual backup of original
2. ✅ Extract and verify with hash
3. ✅ Make minimal changes
4. ✅ Test in isolated environment
5. ✅ Verify hash after repacking
6. ✅ Document all changes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: "Cannot read bundle" error**
- Ensure file is a valid .NET single-file bundle
- Check if .NET version is supported
- Verify file is not corrupted

**Q: Repack fails**
- Original bundle must be in `in/` folder
- Check if work folder matches bundle name
- Review logs in `logs/` folder

**Q: Modified files not updating**
- Ensure files are in correct relative path
- File names are case-sensitive on Linux/Mac
- Check logs for detailed error messages

**Q: Hash verification shows all files modified**
- Ensure you're comparing against correct hash file
- Check if bundle version matches
- Verify file was not re-extracted
